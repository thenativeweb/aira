## Installation

```shell
$ npm install aira
```

## Quick Start

First you need to add a reference to `aira` to your application:

```javascript
const { getNoteLengths, Tb3, Tr8, System8 } = require('aira');
```

If you use TypeScript, use the following code instead:

```typescript
import { getNoteLengths, Tb3, Tr8, System8 } from 'aira';
```

For information on how to use these types, please refer to the demo mentioned below. Detailed documentation will be added once the API is a little bit more stable.
